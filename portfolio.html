        <hr width=30%>
        <p>The game involves a tide pod that is trying to escape being eaten <br>
        from the open mouths of teenagers. The scoring system uses the data variable<br>
        "score" that increases by 1 every 1.5 seconds. The randomness occurs in<br>
        the change of the y-position of the humans. In addition, the random changes<br>
        contribute to the difficulty of the game. The game concludes when the tide<br>
        pod touches the ground, a human, or the edge of the screen.</p>

        <p>I wanted to create this game to advocate for awareness of tide pod eating<br>
        and to showcase the detrimental effects of doing so. I was inspired to <br>
        show my peers through a simple game that if you eat a tide pod then it's<br>
        <b>"GAME OVER"</b> for life. Two successes in the development process <br>
        were creating sprites for the scoring system and drawing a tide pod. An <br>
        obstacle I had was the positioning and drawing of the humans. In the end <br>
        I drew them in costumes tab and adjusted them accordingly. Another <br>
        obstacle that I encountered was trying to have a "restart" button on the <br> 
        "GAME OVER" screen, but it didn't work out and I decided to omit it altogether.<br>
        If more time was available, I would want to improve the graphics of the <br>
        humans and try to implement a "restart" button.</p>

        <p>This is an algorithm because the "if" statement sets the rules for the<br> 
        actions that need to be taken following a "yes" or "no" structure. This system <br>
        pictured above follows the sequence and changes the look of the tide pod <br> 
        depending on whether or not the space bar is pressed. </p>

        <p><i>Twinkie Reflection</i> is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" styled <br>
        game with the main character as the player. A story filled with stone cold chicken,<br>
        crocs, and yes, twinkies. With multiple endings, this story will make you think<br>
        about the decisions you choose to make. <br>How will your story end?</p>

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <hr width=30%>
        <p>
            For this game I took each scene of the story as individual functions, <br>
            each scene a piece for the whole story. Each function holds a specific "definition",<br>
            or the necessary code for the scene. The functions are a form of procedural<br>
            abrstraction as each function can easily be called upon with information of the specific<br>
            scene already implemented within the code, providing an efficient way to test the program<br>
            in increments. Within this process of creating multiple  functions I utilized the "run"<br>
            feature in repl.it in order to check the  program for any possible errors. Through repition and <br>
            focus on singular parts of the program I was able to catch grammatical errors, and I was also<br>
            able to refine the storyline through each test. At one point in a test run<br>
            a prompt was not checking for invalid user input and this was resolved by<br>
            making small adjustments to the code and running through it again, each time<br>
            working on the same part. Additionally, I was able to add some "dialouge"<br>
            to one of the prompts that the player was given if an input was invalid <br>
            and the program was set to run independently one function after the other.<br>
